# ILBAIWhatsGoingOnHere
ILBAI F25 Logic game project using ShadowProver to glean 'hidden' information via propositional calculus and FOL, based on decrypted visual fragments in select puzzlers of the "What's Going On Here" Game

This repository contains completed logical encodings for multiple What’s Going On Here puzzles, along with the corresponding ShadowProver outputs and a detailed write-up. Each puzzle presents a short scenario (displayed visually on its card), and the objective is to extract implicit conclusions using:
   - Propositional Logic (PL) encodings
   - First-Order Logic (FOL) encodings with quantifiers
   - ShadowProver to verify entailments and uncover hidden information

The project demonstrates how formal logic can reconstruct stories, intentions, and causal relationships from incomplete observations.
